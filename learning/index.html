        <h3>Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology</h3>
        Planned for after I am finished with Fields Virology. I am interested in all five volumes since they are separated by phyla, and each one includes species that are of interest to me. This book is mainly so I 
        understand bacteriophages and the immune system better, for the purpose of <a href="https://jomoetnt.github.io/coding/">Biosphere Z</a>.

        <h3>Fields Virology</h3>
        Currently in progress. I plan on reading at least the first three volumes, but I would have to read some of the fourth before deciding if I will finish it. Virology has been an interest of mine since at least 2019,
        although my recent interest in immunology has refreshed this interest, along with Biosphere Z.

        <h3>Handbook of Bacteriology - Amrita Rohilla</h3>
        Read in 2024. It seems like a more introductory textbook meant for giving an overview of the subject. I was fairly disappointed with the quality of writing and lack of variety in specific bacteria mentioned, as there were only
        a few short chapters at the end discussing staphylococcus, streptococcus, and miscellaneous families. Nonetheless, it contains specific information on biochemical processes, and also emphasizes the clinical aspect of the discipline.

        <h3>An Elegant Defense</h3>
        Read in 2024. I suddenly became interested in immunology, and this book was recommended to me. It was definitely not what I expected, since it is essentially the memoir of a journalist whose friend had cancer. Although it summarizes the history
        of immunology as a science, it lacks specifics on how immunity works, which I suppose would be better left to an actual immunologist. Many of the explanations are done through analogy, seeming as if it is targeted for a layperson.
        All in all, it is more of a book for entertainment that may teach you something along the way, rather than a book exclusively for learning. I was interested in reading other immunology books after this, but I think the virology and
        bacteriology textbooks cover enough information about the immune system for my purposes.

        <h3>Linux From Scratch</h3>
        Read in 2024. This book walks you through how to make your own custom distribution of Linux. It is considered a challenging exercise for experienced Linux users, and almost never a practical activity. I read through it, and I might actually try 
        doing it one day.

        <h3>The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual Version 2.2</h3>
        Read in 2024. This document has two volumes: one for user-level, and one for privileged modes (i.e. machine, hypervisor, or supervisor). I was interested in knowing the specifics for how RISC-V assembly works, and what the different extensions
        mean, as each one has a specific identifier.

        <h3>Ballistics - Donald E. Carlucci and Sidney S. Jacobson</h3>
        Read in 2024. I had a passing interest in guns and ballistics for a while.
      </section>

        <h3>The Principia - Isaac Newton</h3>
        Read in 2024. I read various translations of this famous work and compared them with the original Latin. I was also interested in a few other classic physics texts, such as Gauss's theory of mathematical physics, and Euler's Mechanica, but
        figured it would be better to pick a more well-known work with more translations.

        <h3>Extreme Privacy - Michael Bazzell</h3>
        Read in 2024. A guidebook on how to become completely anonymous, or "off-the-grid" as it is sometimes referred to. It contains useful information even for those who are not interested in going all the way, 
        although it is pretty specific to the USA, which is one of the easier western countries to disappear in (especially in certain states the book mentions, such as New Hampshire). It provides both legal and cybersecurity advice, 
        and explains in very clear terms with justification at every step. I also like that Bazzell shares anecdotes about clients he has helped in the past, including times things have gone wrong.

        <h3>Industrial Society and its Future - Theodore J. Kaczynski</h3>
        Read in 2024. An interesting look into the mind of the Unabomber. There really is not much else to say.
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Abstract Algebra - David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote</h3>
        Read in 2023. I thought a rigorous approach to group theory would give me a better understanding than the intuitive one I had absorbed from YouTube videos by Socratica and 3blue1brown. It actually did help solidify some things, but I never ended up 
        reaching rings, fields, or galois theory unfortunately.

        <h3>Introduction to Quantum Mechanics - David J. Griffiths</h3>
        Read in 2022. I had tried a few other textbooks and did not really find them to be compatible with my learning style. I also liked electrodynamics by Griffiths when I read it. However, in the end, I preferred Shankar's QM book.
      </section>

        <h3>General Relativity - Robert Wald</h3>
        Read in 2021. I found general relativity to be a really interesting topic between middle school and high school, so I made it a goal of mine to understand the Einstein field equations. It took a few years to get to the point where I felt I could
        benefit from reading a book such as this.

        <h3>Molecules - Theodore Gray</h3>
        Read in 2014. At this point in my life, I still wanted to be a chemist, and I had really enjoyed Theodore Gray's earlier book, The Elements. This was one of the first times I was exposed to concepts in quantum mechanics, such as electron orbitals.
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The Elements - Theodore Gray</h3>
        Read in 2012/2013. I was fascinated with the periodic table of elements, so my parents bought me a book on it. This sparked my interest in chemistry as well as the sciences in general.
